	PROJECT LAYOUT


	PuttyDLL is a native C project which is almost a direct replica of PUTTY.DSP project from the official PuTTY source code.
	Key differences:
It's been converted to a VS2008 project via the upgrade manager (which worked flawlessly)
It now generates DLLs instead of EXEs
_*_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE have been added to supress warning spam from standard library functions
export.c has been added which exposes methods for PuttySharp (C#) to PInvoke
Other source files may be modified to expose more to export.c -- should be mostly cosmetic/making availbe outside the TU


	PuttySharp is a C# library which wraps the methods exposed by PuttyDLL for easier consumption in C#
It is currently small enough that it ended up well commented and designed.  This probably won't last very long.


	ShinyConsole is a C# program which provides and tests SlimDX/D3D9 based console text rendering
It is crufty and in need of sanitization.
It is used as a library by TtyPlayer, despite being a program.


	TtyRecMonkey is the main C# program which is the point of this project.  It is not well written.
	It currently handles:
Parsing (to be spin off?) of TtyRecs
Basic playback of TtyRecs
